# Wordpress Markdown React Renderer

---

There are plenty of 'Headless CMS' static and dynamic site generators out there already, but I thought this would be a fun project to start from scratch as an educational exercise to learn the concepts involved.

At this time, none of these features have been fully implemented.

### Feature goals:

- Content retrieval from Wordpress REST API interface
- Render locally or remotely located markdown files
- Maybe retrieving + rendering gists (?)
- Agnostic, reusable React components
- Common UI framework (right now Bootstrap, might migrate to Material-UI)
- Preference toward functional vs procedural code
