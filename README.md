# Wordpress Markdown React Renderer

---

There are plenty of 'Headless CMS' static and dynamic site generators out there already, but I thought this would be a fun project to start from scratch as an educational exercise to learn a lot of the concepts involved.

It should be considered too alpha for production in this stage of development, but perhaps it could potentially turn into a fully functional headless CMS package

### Feature goals:

- Content retrieval from Wordpress REST API interface
- Render locally or remotely located markdown files
- Agnostic, reusable React components
- Common UI framework (right now Bootstrap, but might migrate to Material-UI)
- Preference toward functional vs procedural code
